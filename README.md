# rhythmic-bullets

In this short prototype, you need to dodge all of bullets flying your direction to the rhythm of "Let You Go" by SVRGE.

## Controls

You control your player by moving your mouse around, you are confined to just the center circle. The game can be paused by clicking in the center or pressing Escape.

## Soundtrack

This prototype uses the song "Let You Go" by SVRGE, it can be found here.

## Future

I am planning on expanding this project further by including more songs, level selection and hopefully level editing.

### I hope you enjoy the prototype!
